Some macros to jump around to well-known folders:

```
bind index,pager g noop # disable previous g binding
macro index,pager gi <change-folder>+<enter# go to Inbox 
macro index,pager gs <change-folder>+Sent<enter# go to Sent
macro index,pager gd <change-folder>+Drafts<enter# go to Drafts
macro index,pager gt <change-folder>+Trash<enter# go to Trash
macro index,pager gj <change-folder>+Junk<enter# go to Junk
```

**Note:** In some cases, when using multiple accounts (such as with GMail), it's best to keep these macros in separate configs and source each config after `$folder` is changed.
