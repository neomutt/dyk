 If you a bad typer, especially when it comes to writing email addresses, you'll be annoyed by the `To:` prompt's suddenly disappearing when you hit one too many backspaces to correct a typo.

To your rescue comes `set abort_backspace = no`. It will keep the prompt alive and ready for your next typo ;)
