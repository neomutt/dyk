Long or awkward subjects can be remedied with the `subjectrx` command in your configuration file. See more on specifics
[here](https://neomutt.org/guide/advancedusage#12-%C2%A0display-munging).

## Examples

### Coverity Reports

Coverity reports have a pretty long subject. A simple regex-based substitution on the subject will make them look better:

```diff
-86  ( 21K)    +   [Jul 30 20 06:34]  scan-admin@coverity.com      New Defects reported by Coverity Scan for FreeBSD
+86  ( 21K)    +   [Jul 30 20 06:34]  scan-admin@coverity.com      Coverity - FreeBSD
```

The command to achieve that is `subjectrx "^New Defects reported by Coverity Scan for (.*)$" "Coverity - %1"`.

### Mailing Lists

If you're like me and push mail from different mailing lists in different folders, you don't need to be reminded of which mailing list they belong to by their subject line. I like to modify them like this:

```diff
-1  (1.9K)        [Sep 23 19 20:06]  TclConference  [fossil-users] Schedule Up - 26th Annual Tcl/Tk Conference (Tcl'2019)
+1  (4.8K)        [Sep 23 19 20:06]  TclConference  Schedule Up - 26th Annual Tcl/Tk Conference (Tcl'2019)
```

The command to achieve that as a general solution for mailing list subjects is `subjectrx '(\[[^]]*\] )' '%L%R'`. For Neomutt mailing lists only, one can use `subjectrx '\[neomutt-devel\] *' '%L%R'` or `subjectrx '\[neomutt-users\] *' '%L%R'`.

Use `%1`, `%2`, ... to use capture groups in substitutions. Use `%L` and `%R` to use what comes to the left and to the right of the capture.
