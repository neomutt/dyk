To create convenient distributions lists, use the alias function as follows:

**.neomuttrc**
```
alias groupname Joe Smith <joe.smith@anon.xyz>, Jane Smith <jane.smith@anon.xyz>
```
Add as many names as you like, but entries must be comma separated. Then, simply type the name of the group in the To:, Cc:, or Bcc: prompt and all the alias entries will populate that field.
